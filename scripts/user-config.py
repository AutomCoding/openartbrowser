# ############# SETTINGS TO AVOID SERVER OVERLOAD ##############

# Slow down the robot such that it never requests a second page within
# 'minthrottle' seconds. This can be lengthened if the server is slow,
# but never more than 'maxthrottle' seconds. However - if you are running
# more than one bot in parallel the times are lengthened.
#
# 'maxlag' is used to control the rate of server access (see below).
# Set minthrottle to non-zero to use a throttle on read access.
minthrottle = 0
maxthrottle = 60

# Slow down the robot such that it never makes a second page edit within
# 'put_throttle' seconds.
put_throttle = 10

# Sometimes you want to know when a delay is inserted. If a delay is larger
# than 'noisysleep' seconds, it is logged on the screen.
noisysleep = 5.0

# Defer bot edits during periods of database server lag. For details, see
# https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Maxlag_parameter
# You can set this variable to a number of seconds, or to None (or 0) to
# disable this behavior. Higher values are more aggressive in seeking
# access to the wiki.
# Non-Wikimedia wikis may or may not support this feature; for families
# that do not use it, it is recommended to set minthrottle (above) to
# at least 1 second.
maxlag = 0

# Maximum of pages which can be retrieved at one time from wiki server.
# -1 indicates limit by api restriction
step = -1

# Maximum number of times to retry an API request before quitting.

# Minimum time to wait before resubmitting a failed API request.

# ############# LOGFILE SETTINGS ##############

# Defines for which scripts a logfile should be enabled. Logfiles will be
# saved in the 'logs' subdirectory.
#
# Example:
#     log = ['interwiki', 'weblinkchecker', 'table2wiki']
# It is also possible to enable logging for all scripts, using this line:
#     log = ['*']
# To disable all logging, use this:
#     log = []
# Per default, logging of interwiki.py is enabled because its logfiles can
# be used to generate so-called warnfiles.
# This setting can be overridden by the -log or -nolog command-line arguments.
log = ["*"]
# filename defaults to modulename-bot.log
logfilename = None
# maximal size of a logfile in kilobytes. If the size reached that limit the
# logfile will be renamed (if logfilecount is not 0) and the old file is filled
# again. logfilesize must be an integer value
logfilesize = 4096
# Number of rotating logfiles are created. The older files get the higher
# number. If logfilecount is 0, no logfile will be archived but the current
# logfile will be overwritten if the file size reached the logfilesize above.
# If logfilecount is -1 there are no rotating logfiles but the files where
# renamed if the logfile is full. The newest file gets the highest number until
# some logfiles where deleted.
logfilecount = 5
# set to 1 (or higher) to generate "informative" messages to terminal
verbose_output = 0
# set to True to fetch the pywiki version online
log_pywiki_repo_version = False
# if True, include a lot of debugging info in logfile
# (overrides log setting above)
debug_log = []
